# kiss-angular-seed
*promoting bad **practices** in software engineering*

## What is this?

A simple seed project in order to "get things done". No tests. Because sometimes
you just want this prototype **now**.
This seed repo is convenient for simple weekend projects.

## What's included?

* [Angular](https://angularjs.org/) (of course) via the official CDN (https://code.angularjs.org/1.2.27/)
* [nodemon](http://nodemon.io/) watches and restarts your server if needed
* [Stylus](http://learnboost.github.io/stylus/) - expressive, dynamic, robust CSS
* [Express](http://expressjs.com/) - because sometimes you just want a server
* [body-parser](https://github.com/expressjs/body-parser) for building beautiful REST APIs
* [Pure Grids](http://purecss.io/grids/) - a simple CSS grid system

## Available npm scripts

Everything more than a simple npm script would be an overkill.
npm scripts can be run via `npm run scriptname`.

* `npm run build-css`
* `npm run watch-css`
* `npm run watch-server`
* `npm run watch`
* `npm run dev`
* `npm start`

The only scripts you really need are `npm start` for production and `npm run dev`
for development.

## What this is (probably) not

A boilerplate for your next startup. If you need tests, this is not for you. And
you should always write tests (of course).

## Getting started

`git clone https://github.com/alexanderGugel/kiss-angular-seed.git && cd kiss-angular-seed && npm i && npm run dev`

Can it really be that easy? - There is only one way to find out.
